# Tasks i worked on
#### First week into the project, here is what i did below

Started off with doing personal *researh* on the project for the team,finding out about the project,what it is and how to about it.The technologies to be used and
compilation of all the reasearch - https://github.com/zuri-training/Pro_Team_41_Chunk-File/issues/117#issuecomment-1209175886

I updated the assigned tasks for the developers - https://github.com/zuri-training/Pro_Team_41_Chunk-File/issues/117#issue-1332990512
I had to frequently reach out to all the developers in my team as well as collaborating with the designers to produce a great result.

#### Deep into the project
I was also assigned tp the frontend part of the project,I was originally meant to work on the About page.
I started working on it for about two days before my laptop crashed and the task had to be reassigned to one of my team members to work on.

Seeing as i don't have a laptop to work with,i was fully assigned to work on the documentation with the designers.
It took me a lot of work and patience to finish,I had to go around and gather resources from each of the developers,disrturbing them.

I worked on the ***technical documentation*** https://github.com/zuri-training/Pro_Team_41_Chunk-File/issues/117#issuecomment-1209154775
for days,i missed track and was working on the wrong thing - https://github.com/zuri-training/Pro_Team_41_Chunk-File/issues/117#issuecomment-1209168493
got back on my feets and finished on time.

I did learn how to properly communicate with my team members.
One thing i will emphasize on is making research,i made **Google** my friend and it really helped me a lot in solving my problems.
