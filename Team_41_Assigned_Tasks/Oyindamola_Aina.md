##Tasks i worked on
Started off with doing personal researh on the project for the team,finding out about the project,what it is and how to about it.The technolobgies to be used
Compilation of all the reasearch
Helped in preparing fo the first presentation with our designers  by poviding them with informations from the developers side
I was in charge of documenting the developes meetings and keeping charge and watching over our progress throughout the project
I had to frequently resch out to all the developers in my team as well as colaborating with the designers to produce a great result
Logo design
I was also assigned tp the frontend part of the project,i was originally meant to work on the About page but when i started working om it for about two days my system-
crashed and the task had to be reassigned to one of my team members to work on
Seeing as i don't have a laptop to work with,i was fully assigned to wotk on the documentation with the designers
It took me a lot of work and patience to finish,i had to go around and gather resources from each of the developers,disrturbing them
I worked on thetechnical documentation for days,i missed track and was working on the wrong thing,got back on ,my feets and finished on time
I did learn how to properly communicate with my team members
one thing i will emphasize on is making research,i made Google my friend and it really helped me a lot in solving my problems
